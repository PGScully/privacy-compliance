# Privacy review, audit and policy drafting

Work against the privacy legislation below to do one of three things:

- **Review** software, designs, data flows and written policies, and flag issues
  with precise citations (sections 1–5).
- **Draft or update a privacy policy / privacy notice**, with every required
  element traced to its provision (section 6).
- **Audit** requirements, designs, code and documentation against a defined scope
  and criteria at any lifecycle stage, producing a rated control matrix and a report
  (section 7).

Every mode starts by choosing the jurisdiction(s) below.

> This skill supports engineering, design and documentation work, not legal
> advice. Flag uncertainty and recommend qualified legal advice for novel,
> high-risk or disputed questions.

## 1. Choose the jurisdiction(s)

Determine which regimes apply before reviewing anything. If more than one applies,
review under each and report overlapping findings once, citing both.

| Regime                                         | Applies when                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Reference                   | Official text                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Australia — Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)**         | An APP entity (agency or organisation) with an Australian link, or a file number recipient / credit reporting body.                                                                                                         | `references/australia/`     | [legislation.gov.au](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A03712/latest/text)                                                                                                         |

| **EU — AI Act (2024/1689)**                    | Placing on the market, putting into service or using AI systems with EU effect, including non-EU providers.                                                                                                                 | `references/eu/ai-act.md`   | [EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj)                                                                                                                            |
| **EU — Data Act (2023/2854)**                  | Connected products, related services, data sharing, cloud switching or unlawful governmental access with EU effect.                                                                                                         | `references/eu/data-act.md` | [EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/2854/oj)                                                                                                                            |
| **USA / California — CCPA + CCPA Regulations** | A for-profit business doing business in California that meets a threshold (revenue, 100,000+ consumers/households, or 50%+ revenue from selling/sharing), or a service provider/contractor/third party handling their data. | `references/usa/`           | [CCPA statute](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&division=3.&title=1.81.5.&part=4.); [CCPA Regulations](https://cppa.ca.gov/regulations/) |

The references summarise each instrument and cite the exact provisions. **This
package does not ship the full statutes** (to keep it small). Use the official
texts linked above to quote or verify a provision when a point is contested or
high-stakes. Per-instrument last-checked and last-updated dates are recorded in
`references/legislation-status.md`. When in doubt about which regime applies, state
the assumption.

## 2. Task A — review workflow

Work through these steps in order. Do not skip step 1 — most false positives come
from applying an obligation that does not apply.

1. **Establish scope.** For each candidate regime, confirm the entity/role, the
   territorial or Australian link, and any exemption or exclusion (e.g. Australian
   small-business and employee-record exemptions; GDPR household and criminal-law
   exclusions; AI Act military/defence, personal-use and R&D exclusions; Data Act
   micro/small-enterprise and non-production exclusions).
2. **Classify the data.** Identify personal data, sensitive/special-category data,
   and any regulated identifiers. Classification drives which clauses apply.
3. **Map the data lifecycle.** For each stage — collect, notify, store, use,
   disclose/share, transfer, retain, destroy — check the corresponding obligation.
4. **Check the special regimes** where relevant: breaches, impact assessments, AI
   risk classification, and government-access safeguards.
5. **Report findings** in the format below, each naming the legislation and
   citing the provision, with a severity.

## 3. Severity

- **Critical** — likely serious interference/breach, a prohibited practice, an
  unreported notifiable breach, or sensitive/special-category processing without a
  lawful basis; exposes the entity to penalties.
- **High** — clear breach of a specific provision with real harm potential.
- **Medium** — a gap likely to breach an obligation in some circumstances, or a
  missing required control.
- **Low** — documentation, policy or transparency improvements; no direct breach.

## 4. Output format

**Citation convention.** Every citation names the legislation *and* the provision —
never a bare `Art 6(1)(a)`, `s 26WE` or `§ 7013`. Name the instrument with its
official identifier on first use, then use the accepted abbreviation:

| Instrument                       | Cite as                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AU Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)        | `Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) s 16C`; `Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) Sch 1 cl 11.1 (APP 11.1)`         |
| EU GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)   | `GDPR Art 6(1)(a)` (first use: `GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) Art 6(1)(a)`)         |
| EU AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689) | `AI Act Art 5(1)(f)` (first use: `AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689) Art 5(1)(f)`)    |
| EU Data Act (Regulation (EU) 2023/2854) | `Data Act Art 4(12)` (first use: `Data Act (Regulation (EU) 2023/2854) Art 4(12)`)    |
| California CCPA                  | `CCPA § 1798.120`                                                                        |
| CCPA Regulations (11 CCR)        | `CCPA Regs § 7013(c)(1)`                                                                  |

Cite to the finest useful granularity (article, paragraph, point, section, clause).
If several instruments apply to one finding, cite each separately — e.g.
`GDPR Art 6(1)(a); Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) APP 3.3`.

```
### [Severity] Short title
- **Issue:** what is wrong or risky.
- **Location:** file:line, component, design section or policy paragraph.
- **Obligation:** exact provision(s), naming the legislation, e.g. Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) Sch 1 cl 11.1 (APP 11.1); GDPR Art 6(1)(a); AI Act Art 5(1)(f); Data Act Art 4(12); CCPA § 1798.120; CCPA Regs § 7013(c)(1).
- **Why it applies:** tie the facts to the provision, including the regime, data class and any exemption/exclusion considered.
- **Recommendation:** a concrete, testable change.
```

End with a **Summary** (counts by severity, per regime) and a **Scope &
assumptions** note (what was reviewed, assumed scope, and any legal questions for
counsel).

## 6. Task B — draft or update a privacy policy

Use this when asked to create or update a privacy policy or privacy notice. The
output is a drafted document plus a coverage check.

### 6.1 Gather the inputs

Ask for, or infer from the repository and mark as assumed, the following. Do not
invent facts — record unknowns as open questions.

- Entity: legal name, contact details, DPO (if any), EU representative or joint
  controllers (if any); entity type and jurisdictions in scope.
- Data: categories of personal information, and separately sensitive/
  special-category data.
- Collection: sources (direct, third parties, automatic) and means.
- Purposes and the **legal basis** for each (GDPR Art 6; and whether reliance is on
  consent or legitimate interests).
- Recipients and categories of recipients.
- Overseas disclosures/transfers: countries and safeguards.
- Retention periods or the criteria used to determine them.
- Marketing, profiling and automated decisions.
- Access, correction, complaint and opt-out mechanisms.

### 6.2 Draft

Start from `assets/privacy-policy-template.md` and fill it in. Keep it concise,
plain-language and up to date (Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) APP 1.3; GDPR Art 12). Delete
inapplicable
sections and remove the annotations before returning the final text.

Consult the jurisdiction requirement checklists while drafting:

- Australia — `references/australia/privacy-policy.md` (required contents in
  **APP 1.4**, collection-notice matters in **APP 5.2**, cross-border in **APP 8**).
- EU — `references/eu/privacy-notice.md` (transparency in **GDPR Art 12**, content
  for data collected from the subject in **GDPR Art 13**, from other sources in
  **GDPR Art 14**, plus GDPR Art 8, 21, 22, 26, 27, 37 and AI Act Art 50).
- USA / California — `references/usa/privacy-policy.md` (privacy policy and
  Notice at Collection content, opt-out/limit/financial-incentive notices, and the
  ADMT Pre-use Notice under CCPA Regs §§ 7011–7016, 7220).

Where more than one applies, produce a combined or layered notice that satisfies
all of them, with clearly separated jurisdiction sections where the wording
differs.

### 6.3 Validate and report

Return, after the draft:

1. **Coverage check** — a table mapping each required element (Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)
   APP 1.4(a)–(g); GDPR Art 13(1)–(2) / Art 14; CCPA Regs § 7011(e) / § 7012(e)) to the
   section of the draft that satisfies it.
2. **Gaps and open questions** — every placeholder or assumed fact that must be
   confirmed before publishing.
3. **Publication checklist** — dated and versioned, available free of charge and in

## 7. Task C — audit across the lifecycle

Use this when asked to audit for privacy compliance. An audit is a structured,
evidence-based assessment against defined criteria that produces a rated control
matrix and a report — distinct from the ad-hoc review in Task A.

**Audits are not limited to code.** They apply at every stage, including before any
code exists. Establish the **stage(s)** first: it determines the artefacts you can
examine and the kind of finding you can raise.

| Stage                           | Primary artefacts                                                                                                     | Audit focus                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Requirements / discovery**    | requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, process and data-flow descriptions, business case, RFP, data sources | Is the *planned* processing lawful, necessary and proportionate? What privacy requirements must be added (notice, consent, retention, access/correction, cross-border, security)? |
| **Design / architecture**       | architecture and data models, API contracts, IaC plans, vendor/subprocessor selection, threat model, DPIA draft       | Are the required controls *designed in* (minimisation, security, retention, DPbD)?                                                                                                |
| **Development / build**         | code, config, migrations, tests, CI checks                                                                            | Are the designed and required controls *actually implemented*?                                                                                                                    |
| **Pre-release / readiness**     | release checklist, published notices, runbooks, training                                                              | Can the entity meet its obligations from day one?                                                                                                                                 |
| **Post-deployment / operation** | logs, access reviews, data-subject-request records, breach register, retention jobs, monitoring, training records     | Do the controls *operate effectively* over time?                                                                                                                                  |
| **Change / update**             | change requests, PRs, release notes, migrations, new data fields or vendors                                           | Does the change preserve compliance; does it introduce new processing?                                                                                                            |

An audit may cover one stage (e.g. a requirements review, a pre-release readiness
check, a change impact audit) or several. State which stages are in scope and which
are excluded. Where the audit is pre-code, findings will often be **requirements or
design gaps** rather than defects — recommend the requirement, control or design
change needed.

### 7.1 Plan

Record the objective; the **stage(s)** and **scope** (requirements/design set,
repositories, services, environments, documentation, period) with explicit
**exclusions**; the **criteria** (exact legislation and version); the approach
(evidence-based; note limits, e.g. design-only or no operating-effectiveness
testing); and where legal sign-off is required. Prioritise high-risk processing.

### 7.2 Collect evidence

Enumerate the evidence that exists **at the stage in scope** — before concluding.

- **Pre-code:** requirements and user stories, data-flow and process diagrams,
  architecture and data models (planned), vendor selection and data-processing
  intent, DPIA drafts, acceptance criteria.
- **Build and later:** schemas and migrations, collection points, consent
  configuration, IAM and encryption settings, retention/deletion jobs, subprocessor
  and transfer documents, rights workflows, logging, breach runbooks, vendor
  contracts, and operational records (DSR logs, access reviews, breach register).

Record **where** each item is (file:line, config path, document section, or planned
requirement ID). The full evidence map is in `references/audit.md` (section 2).

### 7.3 Test every control

Work through the jurisdiction checklist control by control and **rate each one**
(Conforms / Partially conforms / Does not conform / Not applicable / Not tested).
Adapt the procedure to the stage — for example, test necessity (AU APP 3; GDPR
Art 5(1)(c)) by challenging each planned data element at requirements, by inspecting
the schema at build, and by sampling real records in operation. At pre-code stages,
controls are assessed **by design**; state that operating effectiveness was not
tested.

  Schedule 2, and conditional credit-reporting/code controls).

  transfers; AI Act; Data Act).
- USA / California — `references/usa/audit-checklist.md` (CCPA collection limits,

  assessment and ADMT controls).

### 7.4 Report

Produce findings in the audit finding format (criteria, condition, evidence, cause,
effect, recommendation, management response), stating the **stage** for each; a
**control matrix** with a rating per control; an **evidence index**; and an
**overall opinion** (Reasonable assurance / Qualified / Adverse / Insufficient
evidence). Where the audit is pre-implementation, make clear that assurance is over
requirements and design only. Start from `assets/audit-report-template.md`; the
method and rating scales are in `references/audit.md`.
